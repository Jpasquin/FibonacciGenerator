# Fibonacci Sequence Generator
Fibonacci Sequence Generator
## Get Started
- Start by running ServerSide.py using the command 'python3 ServerSide.py'
- In a seperate session, run ClientSide.py using the command 'python3 ClientSide.py'
- Once connected, enter the index of a Fibonacci number and the amount of rows you would like to see
- Results!

## How it works
The first input provided by the user is the index of a Fibonacci number, the second input is the amount of rows desired to be displayed after.
Using a websocket, the client connects to the server which then sends a response expecting values from the user.
